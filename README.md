# Welcome to Calendar.js:

This is a JavaScript calendar library that is fully responsive and compatible with all modern browsers.

To get started, download the source code and run the "index.html" file.  This will show an example of a calendar with most option enabled.

For further help with configuration, everything is documented in the unminimized "src/calendarjs.js" JavaScript file.
