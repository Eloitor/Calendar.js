# Welcome to Calendar.js:

This is a JavaScript calendar library that is fully responsive and compatible with all modern browsers.

Features include:
- Adding, updating, and removing events, with full custom colors support.
- Full API available via public functions.
- Drag and Drop for events.
- Configurable text for translations.
- Day, Week, Month, and All Events views.
- Fully styled in CSS/SASS (including the buttons).
- Custom events for actions (adding/updating/removing events, skipping months, etc).
- Export to CSV, XML, JSON and TEXT.
- Full-screen mode (double clicking the title bar).
- Search support.

To get started, download the source code and run the "index.html" file.  This will show an example of a calendar with most option enabled.

For further help with configuration, everything is documented in the unminimized "src/calendarjs.js" JavaScript file.
